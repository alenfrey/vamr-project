$$
\textbf{1. World Point to Image Point Projection}
$$

The main equation for projecting a 3D world point \( P_w = (X_w, Y_w, Z_w) \) to a 2D image point \( p = (u, v) \) is:

$$
\lambda \begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = K [R \mid T] \begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- **\[R \mid T\]**: This is the extrinsic matrix combining a rotation matrix \( R \) and a translation vector \( T \), transforming coordinates from world space to camera space.
    - \( R \) is a 3x3 rotation matrix.
    - \( T \) is a 3x1 translation vector.
    - The combined extrinsic matrix is 3x4 in size.

- **\( K \)**: This is the camera's intrinsic matrix, a 3x3 matrix that includes:
    - Focal length (\( \alpha \)).
    - Optical center coordinates (\( u_0, v_0 \)).
    - The matrix is typically defined as:
      $$
      K = \begin{bmatrix}
      \alpha & 0 & u_0 \\
      0 & \alpha & v_0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1
      \end{bmatrix}
      $$

- **Homogeneous Coordinates**: The point in the world is represented in homogeneous coordinates (4x1 vector) to facilitate the matrix multiplication.

- **Projection**: The multiplication of these matrices and the homogeneous coordinate vector transforms the point from world coordinates to camera coordinates, and then to the image plane.

- **\(\lambda\)**: This scalar represents the depth in the camera coordinate system and is used to normalize the coordinates, effectively projecting the point onto the 2D image plane.

$$
\textbf{2. Accounting for Radial Distortion}
$$

Real-world lenses often introduce radial distortion, which is corrected using the following equations:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
u_d \\
v_d
\end{bmatrix} = (1 + k_1 r^2) \begin{bmatrix}
u - u_0 \\
v - v_0
\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
u_0 \\
v_0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- \( (u_d, v_d) \): Distorted pixel coordinates.
- \( k_1 \): Coefficient of radial distortion.
- \( r^2 = (u - u_0)^2 + (v - v_0)^2 \): The squared distance from the optical center, used to calculate the amount of distortion.

$$
\textbf{3. Notation for Complete Projection Including Distortion}
$$

The entire process of projecting a 3D point to a 2D point, including lens distortion, can be summarized as a function:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
u_d \\
v_d
\end{bmatrix} = \pi(P_W, K, k_1, R, T)
$$

This function notation \( \pi \) symbolically represents the entire projection process, encapsulating both geometric transformations and lens distortion corrections.

$$
\textbf{Summary}
$$

In this detailed summary, we have outlined the entire process of projecting a 3D point in the world coordinate system to a 2D point on an image plane. This process involves transforming the coordinates from world space to camera space using extrinsic parameters (rotation and translation), scaling and translating based on camera intrinsic parameters (like focal length and optical center), and correcting for real-world lens distortions. The process is essential in computer vision and photogrammetry for accurately mapping 3D space onto 2D images.
