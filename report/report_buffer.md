# Report Buffer
This file contains the report buffer. It is a place to store ideas, important points and content for the report, before actually putting them into the report. It is not meant to be read by anyone other than the team, and just serves as a place to store ideas that can be later added to the final report. Feel free to add anything you think is important to the report here.
