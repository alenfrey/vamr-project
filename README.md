# Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics - Project

## Screencasts

* Parking: https://youtu.be/W_FU94QPROM
* Kitti: https://youtu.be/BZOVhOeJ-Cw
* Malaga: https://youtu.be/CdZAbssPqkc

The screencasts were recorded on a Macbook Pro M1 with 16 GiB. 
The code was executed in the conda environment on the CPU.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (for managing the environment)
- [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Setting Up the Conda Environment
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/alenfrey/vamr-project
   cd vamr-project
   ```

2. Create and activate the Conda environment, and install the required packages:
   ```
   conda env create -f env.yml
   conda activate vamr
   ```

## Usage

### Downloading the Datasets
To download the datasets, run the python script `download_datasets.py` from the project root directory:
   ```
   python3 download_datasets.py
   ```

## Testing

This project uses `pytest` and `Hypothesis` for testing to ensure code quality and reliability.

### Running Tests

The parking dataset needs to be downloaded before running the tests.
To run the tests, navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

`pytest` will automatically discover and run all tests in the project, including those generated by `Hypothesis`.

### Writing Tests

Our tests are located in the `tests` directory.
